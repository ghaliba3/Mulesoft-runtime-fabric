Insight is a troubleshooting tool that gives you in-depth visibility into business transactions and events on your Mule apps deployed CloudHub and on-premises servers. Insight tracks everything your data does in an app and replays your transactions instantly, so you can find and recover from errors that occur during message processing.

Insight helps you answer questions about your integrated apps, such as:

* What happened with a particular transaction or synchronization?
* When did the transaction occur? How long did it take?
* What was the result of a transaction?
* If something went wrong during processing, at what point did the failure occur?

Use the Insight Dashboard to view events that occur within the flows that handle your business transactions. To analyze the root cause of failures, isolate performance bottlenecks, and test for compliance with company procedures, drill down into event-related data.


Do not enable Insight for long periods of time for production environments. Insight is enabled, data processing performance is affected. 
To track, aggregate, and store Mule events by default, Insight requires some processing and network overhead. 

To monitor a production environment, use the tools listed in the xref:monitoring.adoc[monitoring section].

== Limitations

With Insight:

* A single application is limited to 50,000 events per minute.
* All applications in a single business group are limited to 100,000 events per minute. 

Events over these limits are dropped. 

In addition, no more than 20 custom event definitions per application definition are stored.  

Do not leave Insight enabled for extended periods of time in production environments. You should use Insight for troubleshooting purposes only. 

Insight does not support visibility into xref:3.8@mule-runtime::batch-processing.adoc[batch processing].

== Enable or Disable Insight


To enable Insight to track the events your Mule servers generate:

. Sign into your Anypoint Platform account.
. Click *Runtime Manager*.
. Click *Applications* in the menu on the left, and click the application in the *File* column to open the management panel on the right side of the page. 
. In the management panel, click *Insight*.
. Click *Settings* in the menu on the left, and then click the *Insight* tab:
+
image::insight-320c1.png[]

. Select one of the tracking options:
** *Disabled* to disable Insight
** *Metadata* to track only events
** *Metadata and Replay* to track events and enable the ability to instantly replay a transaction from the console. For more information, see <<diagnosing_problems,Diagnosing Problems and Replaying Transactions>>.
+
This option is available only on Mule 3 applications deployed to CloudHub, and replay only works for flows that have inbound endpoints.
. Click *Apply Changes* to apply the settings.
+
After you enable Insight, the following events are tracked by default:
+
* Data that passes through endpoints (inbound and outbound) in your Mule applications
* Flow initiation and completion
* Custom business events you embed in your Mule flows
+
Logs for applications deployed to servers on-premises contain event information, but not message contents.

[[set_up_business_events]]
== Setting Up Business Events

You can configure business events in your Mule applications by embedding custom business events in flows or by enabling granular event tracking within message processors in your flows.

* *Custom Business Events*
+
Include custom business event elements at relevant points within the flows of your application to surface the processing information that is most relevant for your business to track.
* *Event Tracking*
+
Track more granular events by enabling default event tracking for your entire flow or for specific message processors or endpoints within your flow. When you configure the flows in your application, you can explicitly configure the scope for default event tracking.
+
When deploying your application on Runtime Manager, ensure that you select either *Metadata* or *Metadata and Replay* on the *Insight* tab.

== Searching and Filtering Transactions and Events

The *Insight Dashboard* displays information at three tracking levels: 

* *Transactions*
+
Logical groupings of related events that often correspond to a business view of the system.
* *Events*
+
Low-level details of a transaction.
+
Events map to message processors and endpoints and reveal information about exceptions and any custom business events you may have configured.
* *Metadata*
+
Customized key/value pairs that you specify as part of custom events in your application.
+
The information that Insight tracks at this level presents information about high-level business events.

The following image illustrates where to find transactions, events, and metadata on the Insight dashboard.

== Customizing the Transaction ID

For transaction-level events, Insight might display long numeric values in the ID column. You can customize the transaction IDs so that they display more intuitive values that are relevant to your business requirements. 

To do this, use a Mule expression to configure your Mule application to return meaningful information about a transaction, such as order number, tracking number, or employee identification number.

=== Search or Filter Transactions

On the *Insight* tab of the Runtime Manager console, you can search or filter data to refine the results displayed. You can search for:

* A specific transaction by transaction ID.
* Transactions within a specific date range.
* Transactions according to flow name, exception message, processing time, and/or any custom business data.
+
To enable the *Business Data* field your app must have <<set_up_business_events,business events>>.

To search or filter:

. Click *Insight*.
. Enter your search criteria in the *Search* field.
. Click *Advanced* in the *Search* field.
. Specify filter options:
+
image::chintransid.png[CHInTransID]
. Click *Apply*.


* To display only failed or completed transactions, click *Advanced* in the *Search* field, and then select *Failed* or *Completed* from the dropdown list.
+
image::chinany.png[CHInAny]

* To display transactions within a specific date range, specify a date or range in *Date & Time*. Alternatively, click and drag within the graph to select a specific date range:
+
image::ch-date-range-click-drag.png[CH_date+range+click+drag]
* To save a search, click *Save search*:

=== Filtering Events

Within transactions, use the *Transaction Details* to further refine the types of events that Insight displays for each transaction. Click the *Transaction details* dropdown for the event to reveal possible filter criteria. If you are debugging, you migh find it useful to see all events so that you can drill down into the detailed steps of your flow. If you want to analyze higher level business information, you might want to apply a filter so as to view only your custom business events.

image::chtransactiondetails.png[CHTransactionDetails]

The default settings of the events filter depend upon your user role. If your user role is:

* *Support*
+
The default events filter setting display only custom events.
* *Admin* or *Developer*
+
The default events filter setting displays custom events, endpoint events, and message processor events, but does not display flow events.

== Data Persistence

Insight does not have a size limit and displays all transactions in your application for 30 days. Events are kept for two days.

Replay data for applications created before Oct 7, 2017 are stored in the default region: us-east-1.

New applications and applications whose region changed after Oct 7, 2017 use region-specific storage. Insights Replay Data is not preserved when switching regions. You should verify that this doesn't violate any of your compliance requirements.

[[diagnosing_problems]]
== Diagnosing Problems and Replaying Transactions

The Insight message replay feature enables advanced error recovery. When you encounter a failed transaction (as displayed on the Insight dashboard), you can diagnose the problem, fix the root issue, then replay the transaction that failed. The following example demonstrates this functionality.

=== Transaction Failed

For example, when a transaction fails because an application exceeds the limited number of API calls for a Salesforce account, Insight displays the status of the transaction as `Failed`. 

Click to expand the transaction, then examine the individual events within that transaction. The exception and the error message are listed next to the failed event, as well as an existing stack trace.

image::chexcmsg.png[CHExcMsg]

=== Fix Then Replay

After investigating the logs and resolving the issue (for example, by purchasing more API capacity) that caused the transaction failure you can replay the transaction.

The replay feature is supported only for Mule 3 applications and for flows that have inbound endpoints.

Click the replay icon (circular arrow) next to the first event in the failed transaction to replay it:

image::chreplaybutton.png[CHReplayButton]

Insight requests for confirmation (below, top), then confirms that it has replayed the message during which the transaction first failed (below, bottom). Insight displays replayed transactions immediately on the dashboard and in the Logs tab.

image::ch-replay-transaction-replayed.png[CH_replay-transaction-replayed]

== Purge Replay Transaction Data

In the *Insight* tab for an application, click *Purge Replay Data* to delete all existing replay data for that application.

[WARNING]
This action cannot be reversed.
